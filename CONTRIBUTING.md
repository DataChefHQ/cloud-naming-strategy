# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this **Hybrid
Domain-Driven Resource Naming & Tagging Strategy** repo! Please follow
these guidelines to help maintain a cohesive and high-quality project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repo**: Create your own fork of the repository to work
   on.
2. **Clone Locally**: Clone the fork to your local machine.
3. **Set up Environment**: No complex environment is typically needed
   for documentation changes, but ensure you have the necessary tools
   if you plan to add automation scripts or other enhancements.

## Branching and Merge Requests

1. **Branch Naming**:
   - Use short descriptive names, e.g., `feature/add-gcp-sample`,
     `bugfix/typo-in-readme`.
2. **Pull Requests**:
   - Link any relevant issues in your Pull Request (e.g., `Closes
     #12`).
   - Fill in all sections of the pull request template, including
     testing or verification steps if applicable.

## Version Management

- We maintain a **manual version history** in `README.md`.
- Use **Semantic Versioning** if you want (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`),
  or simpler patch versioning if that’s more appropriate.
- **When to bump versions**:
  - **Major** (x.0.0) for breaking changes or major new sections.
  - **Minor** (1.x.0) for new features that are backward-compatible.
  - **Patch** (1.0.x) for small tweaks or fixes.

## Code of Conduct

- Please be respectful to others in all interactions.
- Seek to provide constructive feedback and help each other achieve a
  better solution.

## Reporting Issues

- Check existing issues to see if your concern has already been
  raised.
- Provide as much detail as you can and use the [Issue
  Template](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md).

## Thank You

We appreciate every contribution, whether it’s a bug report, a feature
suggestion, or a pull request!
